#How Important Transformers are?
##Before transformers, NLP models processed text sequentially—slow, limited, and context-poor.

##Transformers changed everything by introducing attention:
1.They understand context across entire sentences
2.They process text in parallel, not word by word
3.They scale incredibly well with data and compute

##This shift unlocked some features like:
1.Machine translation that actually feels natural
2.Search that understands intent, not just keywords
2.Chatbots that can reason, summarize, and generate

Most of today’s AI breakthroughs trace back to one idea that is
'Let the model decide what matters most in the text.'
Transformers didn’t just improve NLP — they redefined it.
