How AI Helps Us to Understand Data Better

1.Ask questions in plain language
“Why did sales drop last month?” instead of writing complex queries.

2.Automatic data summaries
Turns spreadsheets and dashboards into clear explanations.

3.Find patterns & trends
Spots changes, anomalies, and relationships humans might miss.
Explain the “why,” not just the “what”
Helps interpret results, not just show charts.

4.Create reports instantly
Converts data into emails, slides, or summaries for any audience.

5.Help non-technical users analyze data
You don’t need SQL, Python, or statistics to get insights.

6.Clean and prepare data
Detects errors, missing values, and inconsistencies faster.
